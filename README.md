### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
May seems to be the most successful time for kickstarter campaigns. The number of successful campaigns is double that of failed or canceled campaigns.

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
People are more likely to contribute in the range of $1000 - $4999.

- What are some limitations of this dataset?
This is limited to only plays.  
We did not specify when the campaign started and when it ended. So there isn't a time frame and we couldn't pin point what part of
campaign when there was the most succesful.

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
We could compare the pledge amount to the goal amount vs outcomes.
We could also create a graph representing the different types of theater, such as musical v plays.
