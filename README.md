# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
#Successes and Failure of Kickstarters

### Purpose
#This kickstarter analysis will show how the outcome of theater plays and their fundraising goals. 

## Analysis and Challenges
# The number of successful kickstarter campaigns seem to do well during the summer months of May, June and July. 

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
#May had the most successful campaigns, but during the fall and winter months there seems to be a steady decline with the lowest month being December. 

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
The percentage of cancellation based on goals is zero. The number of successful campaigns had a higher percentage in the $1000 to $4999 range coming 
in at 73% successful. 

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
May seems to be the most successful time for kickstarter campaigns. The number of successful campaigns is double that of failed or canceled campaigns.

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
People are more likely to contribute in the range of $1000 - $4999.

- What are some limitations of this dataset?
This is limited to only plays.  
We did not specify when the campaign started and when it ended. So there isn't a time frame and we couldn't pin point what part of
campaign when there was the most succesful.

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
We could compare the pledge amount to the goal amount vs outcomes.
We could also create a graph representing the different types of theater, such as musical v plays.
